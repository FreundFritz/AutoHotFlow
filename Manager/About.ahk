Special thanks to:
- Tariq Porter (tic) for the "GDI+" library. It allows to draw the graphical user interface in the flow editor.
- Boris Mudrinić (Learning One) for the "String-object-file" library. It allows to save list variables to file.
- just me for the "ScrollGUI" library. It allows to make the sometimes large settings GUI to be scrollable.
- Learning one for the "TTS" library. It allows to use the speech output.
- VxE for the "HTTPRequest" library. It allows to make highly configurable HTTP requests.
